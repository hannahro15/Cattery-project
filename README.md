## Project Introduction

This first milestone 1 project is a website for a fake cattery business called 'The Manchester Cattery'. The website is suitable for anyone who is looking for a place for their cat/s to stay for one or more nights when their owner is away for a period of time.

## User stories

The user should be able to find out the purpose of the website and what it is about.

The user should be able to find out information about the cattery itself and the services that it provides.

The user should be able to navigate between different links on the nav bar and across the website easily.

As a user they should be able to easily find opening hours, contact and address information on the website.

When a user clicks on the social media links, it should open up in the correct platform.

As a user they should be able to see pictures of lots of cats on the gallery page.

As a user they should expect the website to be responsive and for everything to be seen clearly on different size screens such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The user expects the website to run smoothly without error messages and the images to load without any issues.
