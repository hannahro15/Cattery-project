# THE MANCHESTER CATTERY

## Project Introduction

This first milestone 1 project is a website for a fake cattery business called 'The Manchester Cattery'. The website is suitable for anyone who is looking for a place for their cat/s to stay for one or more nights when their owner is away for a period of time.

# UX

## User stories

* The user should be able to find out the purpose of the website and what it is about.

* The user should be able to find out information about the cattery itself and the services that it provides.

* The user should be able to navigate between different links on the nav bar and across the website easily.

* As a user they should be able to easily find opening hours, contact and address information on the website.

* When a user clicks on the social media links, it should open up in the correct platform.

* As a user they should be able to see pictures of lots of cats on the gallery page.

* As a user they should expect the website to be responsive and for everything to be seen clearly on different size screens such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.

* The user expects the website to run smoothly without error messages and the images to load without any issues.

# Languages and Frameworks used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 5

# Features



# Testing

* For testing HTML I use the [HTML validator website]("https://validator.w3.org/").
* For testing CSS I use the [CSS validator website](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/").

## Bugs
   
* Centering elements and layout issues on the web pages for different screen sizes due to responsiveness.
* Submit button opening up in separate thank you page even when form hasn't been filled in.
* With images being compressed before and after converting them to WebP, performance is still quite low on some pages on  some screen sizes when running Google Lighthouse. 

# Credits

## Content

* Help with documentation for any code was from the [official Bootstrap website]("https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/") and [W3 schools]("https://www.w3schools.com/") websites. 

* Code I used/altered for the submit button was from the second snippet of code from this [Stack Overflow Page]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34821728/how-can-i-make-a-button-link-to-another-page"). I had to alter it based on the html validator results.

* The colour I chose for the footer was from [the rgb color code website]("https://rgbcolorcode.com/").

* The icons in the footer used were from [FontAwesome]("https://fontawesome.com/icons").

* Markdown help for the Readme was from [this github repo]("https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links").

* For removing some unused css I used the [Unused css website]("https://unused-css.com/").

## Media

* The photos of the cats across the website including the gallery page was from [Pexels]("https://www.pexels.com/").

* For converting images to webp I used a website called [Pixelied]("https://pixelied.com/convert/jpg-converter/jpg-to-webp").

* For compressing images I used the [Tinypng]("https://tinypng.com/") website.

Also thank you in general for the wonderful assistance from the slack community, tutor support and my mentor on Code Institute, and also tutorials/mentoring from the City of Bristol College.

First of all if you are wanting to use the project, you first need to fork [my repository]("https://github.com/hannahro15/Cattery-project") of the project.

Click on the green code button on the top right of the screen and copy this [link to clone]("https://github.com/hannahro15/Cattery-project.git") and then do git clone followed by that link in your terminal to add it to your computer.

## Steps to deploy the website:

Go to settings in [my repository]("https://github.com/hannahro15/Cattery-project").

Then on the side bar on the next page click on 'pages'.
