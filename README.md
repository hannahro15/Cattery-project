# THE MANCHESTER CATTERY

## Project Introduction

This first milestone 1 project is a website for a fake cattery business called 'The Manchester Cattery'. The website is suitable for anyone who is looking for a place for their cat/s to stay for one or more nights when their owner is away for a period of time.

# UX

## User stories

* The user should be able to find out the purpose of the website and what it is about.

* The user should be able to find out information about the cattery itself and the services that it provides.

* The user should be able to navigate between different links on the nav bar and across the website easily.

* As a user they should be able to easily find opening hours, contact and address information on the website.

* When a user clicks on the social media links, it should open up in the correct platform.

* As a user they should be able to see pictures of lots of cats on the gallery page.

* As a user they should expect the website to be responsive and for everything to be seen clearly on different size screens such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.

* The user expects the website to run smoothly without error messages and the images to load without any issues.

# Features



# Testing

* For testing HTML I use the HTML validator.[https://validator.w3.org/].
* For testing CSS I use the CSS validator.[https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/]

## Bugs
   
* Centering elements and layout issues on the web pages for different screen sizes due to responsiveness.
* Submit button opening up in separate thank you page even when form hasn't been filled in.
* With images being compressed before and after converting them to WebP, performance is still quite low on some pages on  some screen sizes when running Google Lighthouse.
